<h2 align="center">Physikos</h2> 

This repo consists of worked examples and exercise artifacts produced in my self-studying pursuit of learning Physics as an adult learner. While I have a degree in Computer Science, my last exposure to Physics was more than 10 years ago; back when I was in secondary school.

## Journey

I am following Susan Rigetti’s physics [guide](https://www.susanrigetti.com/physics). 

## Progress

**Undergraduate Physics**
1. Introduction to Mechanics
  
## Notes

• **24 November 2024**: Transitioned from MIT’s 18.06 Linear Algebra to Susan Rigetti’s physics learning pathway. Started with Intro to Mechanics.
